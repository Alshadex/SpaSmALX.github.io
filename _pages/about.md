Hello World! My name's Alex! I am a student of the University of Toronto studying Mathematics, Computer Science and Statistics.

My focus is more towards **information security**, **scalable backend systems** and **operating systems** development. Sometimes I like to **tutor** as well.

Working forwards, I am very interested in learning blockchain technology development. I believe DeFI is the future.

I guess my tagline is I like working with computers! Programming is one of my passions and I like to enthrall and surround myslef in many interesting projects, job experiences and people. If you want to reach out to me to work on something, don't hesitate. Check out some of my projects and job experiences below!

I am also trying to blog from time to time here!
