Hello World! My name's Alex! I am a student of the University of Toronto studying Mathematics, Computer Science and Statistics.

My focus is more towards **information security**, **scalable backend systems** and **operating systems** development. Sometimes I like to **tutor** as well.

Working forwards, I am very interested in learning blockchain technology development. I believe DeFI is the future.

I guess my tagline is I like working with computers! Programming is my passion and I like to enthrall and surround myslef in many interesting projects, job experiences and people. If you want to reach out to me to work on something, don't hesitate.
